## ðŸ”¹ Introduction

In this series, we are here with a Python project from our **Beginner-Level Project Ideas**.

If youâ€™re just starting your DevOps journey and want to understand how Python can be used for automation, system interaction, and command execution, this project is a perfect starting point.

Weâ€™ll build a **Python-based mini shell** that allows you to run Linux commands directly from a Python script. This simple project demonstrates how Python can interact with the underlying operating systemâ€”a core skill for any DevOps engineer.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Use Case â€“ Why This Project?

In DevOps, engineers often work extensively with the Linux command line for tasks such as:

* Checking system health
    
* Navigating directories
    
* Running deployment or monitoring commands
    

Instead of typing directly into the terminal, Python can act as a **wrapper around the shell**, executing commands programmatically.

This project helps you:

* Understand how Python executes shell commands.
    
* Build a foundation for **automation scripts**.
    
* Think about extending it into advanced DevOps tools (like deployment scripts, monitoring dashboards, or log analyzers).
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ The Code â€“ Python Mini Shell

Hereâ€™s the complete Python script:

```json
import subprocess

command = ""
while command != "exit":
    command = input("bash:# ")
    if command == "exit":
        break
    result = subprocess.getoutput(command)
    print(result)
```

### âœ… How It Works

* `import subprocess` â†’ Imports the Python module that interacts with system commands.
    
* `input("bash:# ")` â†’ Gives the user a shell-like prompt.
    
* **Exit condition** â†’ Typing `exit` will end the program.
    
* `subprocess.getoutput(command)` â†’ Executes the entered command and returns the output.
    
* `print(result)` â†’ Displays the result of the command.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Run

Hereâ€™s what it looks like when you run the script:

```json
bash:# ls
file1.txt file2.py
bash:# pwd
/home/devops
bash:# exit
```

Simple, yet powerful ðŸš€

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tools Required to Get Started

You donâ€™t need a complicated setup to try this project. Just:

* **Python 3** installed on your machine
    
* **VS Code** (or any text editor of your choice)
    
* **Linux Environment** (Ubuntu, CentOS, or WSL if youâ€™re on Windows)
    

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s it! Open VS Code, paste the code, and run it from your terminal.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

This project may look small, but it teaches an important DevOps concept: **using Python to interact with the system**.

As you move forward, you can enhance this project by adding:

* Error handling for invalid commands
    
* Logging output into files
    
* Restricting certain commands for security
    
* Integrating with tools like Docker or Kubernetes
    

This is just the beginning of using Python for DevOps automationâ€”and in the upcoming articles of this series, weâ€™ll explore more exciting beginner and intermediate project ideas.

Stay tuned for the next project in the **Python in DevOps Series**! ðŸŽ¯
