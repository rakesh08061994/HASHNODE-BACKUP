> Note: Write your managed host's IP address and their hostnames in the `./hosts-ip.yml` file and don't forget to include it in your playbook.

```plaintext
vim ./hosts-ip.yml 
hosts-entries:   
  - ip: 192.168.10.1     
    hostname: mh1.example.com
  - ip: 192.168.10.2
    hostname: mh2.example.com  
  - ip: 192.168.10.3
    hostname: mh3.example.com
```

> Make sure to create an inventory file in the same place where your ansible.cfg is located, and don't forget to include it in your playbook.

```plaintext
vim ./inventory

[stage]
mh1.example.com

[test]
mh2.example.com

[prod]
mh3.example.com
```

> This is your ansible configuration playbook

### Description of this playbook in short

This Ansible playbook is designed to set up Ansible on a managed host. Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of what each part does:

1. **Yum repository configuration on server**: This task sets up the Yum repositories on the server. It uses a loop to add two repositories, one for AppStream and one for BaseOS. This task only runs if the serverâ€™s operating system is RedHat or Fedora and the major version is 9 or above.
    
2. **Setup EPEL REPOSITORY**: This task installs the EPEL repository on the server. This task also only runs if the serverâ€™s operating system is RedHat or Fedora and the major version is 9 or above.
    
3. **Install ansible in the machine**: This task installs the latest version of Ansible on the server.
    
4. **Show the result**: This task displays the result of the Ansible installation.
    
5. **Create IP hostname entry in /etc/hosts file of control-node machine**: This task adds entries to the /etc/hosts file on the control node machine. The entries are defined in the `hosts-entries` variable.
    
6. **Create a user**: This task creates a new user on the server. The username and password are defined in the `username` and `password` variables.
    
7. **Enable PermitRootLogin, PubkeyAuthentication, and PasswordAuthentication**: This task modifies the SSH configuration to enable root login, public key authentication, and password authentication.
    
8. **Configure ssh to make password-less connection between machines**: This task sets up SSH keys for the new user to allow password-less connections between machines.
    
9. **Create ansible directory in user home directory**: This task creates a new directory for Ansible in the home directory of the new user.
    
10. **Create ansible.cfg file in user home directory under .ansible directory**: This task creates an Ansible configuration file and an inventory file in the new Ansible directory.
    
11. **Insert details in ansible.cfg file**: This task adds configuration details to the Ansible configuration file.
    
12. **Create inventory file**: This task copies an inventory file to the new Ansible directory.
