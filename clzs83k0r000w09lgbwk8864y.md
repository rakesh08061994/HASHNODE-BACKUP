**Y**ou know how it feels when you forget your Linux password and suddenly canâ€™t do anything on your own machine? It's super frustrating, especially when youâ€™re locked out of something important. Whether youâ€™re using Fedora, Ubuntu, or any other Linux distro, you need that admin access to keep things running smoothlyâ€”installing software, updating the system, all that stuff. Without it, youâ€™re just stuck.

But hereâ€™s the good news: Linux has a safety net. You can actually reset or break the password and get back in control. It might sound a bit intimidating at first, but trust me, with a little guidance, itâ€™s totally doable.

**S**o, imagine this: youâ€™re the system admin, and suddenly you canâ€™t remember your root password. Itâ€™s one of those moments where everything grinds to a halt because, without that password, youâ€™re locked out of doing just about anything important on your system. Maybe you were in the middle of something critical, and now youâ€™re stuck. But donâ€™t worryâ€”Linux has got your back.

### **Resetting the Root Password from the Boot Loader**

If you ever find yourself in this situation, knowing how to reset a lost root password is a skill every system admin needs. If youâ€™re already logged in with sudo access or as root, itâ€™s no big deal. But if youâ€™re not logged in, things get a bit trickier.

> Youâ€™ve got a few options here. Some might suggest booting from a Live CD, mounting your root file system, and then editing `/etc/shadow` to fix the problem. But letâ€™s face it, not everyone wants to fiddle with external media. So, letâ€™s explore a method that doesnâ€™t require any of that.

On older Red Hat systems, you could just boot into runlevel 1 to get a root prompt. In the newer versions, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and beyond, itâ€™s a bit different. Youâ€™ll need to use either the rescue or emergency targets, but hereâ€™s the catchâ€”they still require the root password. If your system was deployed from a Red Hat cloud image, you might not have a rescue kernel in your boot menu, but your default kernel has a trick up its sleeveâ€”it lets you enter maintenance mode without needing the root password.

### **How to Do It:**

### Approach-1

1. **Reboot Your System:** Start by rebooting your machine.
    
    **Interrupt the Boot:** When the boot-loader countdown starts, hit any key (except Enter) to stop it.
    
    > **You will see kernel images here, select "rescue" kernel image. use â†‘ & â†“ arrow key to change the selection.**

    **Select the Rescue Kernel:** Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the entry with the word "rescue" in its name.
    
3. **Edit the Boot Parameters:** Press `e` to edit the selected entry.
    
4. **Modify the Kernel Command Line:** Find the line that begins with `linux` and append `rd.break` at the end after entering a single space. This tells the system to pause just before handing control from the initramfs to the actual system.

5. **Boot with the Changes:** Press `Ctrl+x` to boot with the modified parameters.
    
6. **Maintenance Mode:** When prompted, press Enter to enter maintenance mode.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Now, youâ€™ll have access to a root shell, but thereâ€™s a catchâ€”the root file system is mounted as read-only. Youâ€™ll need to remount it as read/write to make changes</div>
</div>

7. **Remount the File System:** Run this command to remount the root file system as read/write:
    
    ```plaintext
    switch_root:/# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
    ```
    
8. **Enter a Chroot Jail:** This makes `/sysroot` the root of your file-system tree:
    
    ```plaintext
    switch_root:/# chroot /sysroot
    ```
    
9. **Reset the Password:** Set a new root password with this command:
    
    ```plaintext
    sh-5.1# passwd root
    Changing password for user root.
    New password: **********
    Retype new password: **********
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
    ```
    
10. **Ensure Files Get Relabeled:** This step is crucial to avoid SELinux issues later. Run:
    
    ```plaintext
    sh-5.1# touch /.autorelabel
    ```
    
11. **Exit and Reboot:** Type `exit` twiceâ€”once to leave the chroot jail and once to exit the initramfs shell. The system will continue booting, perform a full SELinux relabel, and then reboot again. It will take some time to restart, so login now with new password for the root user.
    
    ```plaintext
    sh-5.1# exit
    switch_root:/# exit
    ```

    New password: **********

    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
    touch /.autorelabel
    /sbin/reboot -f
    ```
    
7. **Ensure Files Get Relabeled:** This step is crucial to avoid SELinux issues later.
    
    ```plaintext
    bash# touch /.autorelabel
    ```
    
8. **Exit and Reboot:** Type `/sbin/reboot -f` and hit enter. Now the system will continue booting, perform a full SELinux relabel, and then reboot again. It will take some time to restart, so login now with new password for the root user.
    
    ```plaintext
    bash# /sbin/reboot -f
    ```
    

And thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re back in business with a new root password, and you didnâ€™t even need to mess around with external media. Whether youâ€™re troubleshooting or just making sure youâ€™re prepared for a rainy day, knowing this trick can save you a lot of headaches.
